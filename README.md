# Mudlet-Text-Colors-Hack
A dirty little hacky script to change the color theme of text in Mudlet. It's actually not meant for use. It's just an experiment to see how Mudlet text looks using some existing color themes.
It includes some color themes that were adapted from those from http://mayccoll.github.io/Gogh/
